Briefly, you will submit a skeleton program, which typically means a set of classes or modules with functions (depends on your programming language) with stub public methods (methods with a correct signature/prototype and return statement, but no implementation at all). The skeleton should include commentsbased on the design. Building a test database (or test data files) is also part of this phase. You will also build a unit test suite as described in the syllabus, using an appropriate testing framework.You will submit a zip file containing your project skeleton and unit tests, and any test resources including files or databases. (The zip often is just the project folder from your development tool, or the top of a Maven or Git project.)It is expected your code will compile and run without error, although none of the tests are expected to pass.Unit Test Suite(Due 10/31/2021) (and code skeleton)\u2014In this phase you translate your design into a skeleton program, which typically means a set of classes or modules with functions (depends on your programming language) withstubpublic methods (methods with a correct signature/prototype and return statement, but no implementation at all).The skeleton should include commentsbased on the design. Building a test database (or test data files) is also part of this phase.You will probably need some simple user interface (for example, a PHP web interface) to be able to examine and update your data. This \"scaffolding\" code is in addition to your actual project code, as is any testing code and deployment scripts. Then build and deliver a unit test suite, based on the design and requirements. You can use any test framework approved by your instructor, but here are recommendations: For Java, use JUnit. For C#, VB, or any .net language, use NUnit. For other languages, find an appropriate testing framework (which you should have your faculty advisor approve).Remember, the purpose of the unit tests is to ensure the implementation properly fulfills the design. You need enough test cases for this. (At this point, none of your tests are expected to pass. You work on making each test pass, one at a time, in the implementation and testing phase.Note for object-oriented, test-drivendevelopment,tests and the detailed design (and the implementation) are all developed at the same time. Your instructor understands that, but for grading purposes you need to submit a test suite before the implementation is done;you are allowed to expand your test suite later.",
